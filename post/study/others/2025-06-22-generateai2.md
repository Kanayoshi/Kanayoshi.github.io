# Problem
Optimization of Urban Bus Driver Schedule Assignment

## Abstract about the problem
A public transportation agency in a certain city operates multiple bus routes from several depots. 
The bus operation is composed of different timetables depending on the day of the week, and on weekdays, 
especially, the demand for commuting to work and school is high. 
For the buses and drivers belonging to each depot, 
it is necessary to optimally assign the drivers’ work schedules while complying with legal and operational constraints.

## Objective
Minimize the total working hours of all drivers (or minimize the working hours of the driver with the longest shift)

## Constraints
- The working hours per day for each driver must not exceed 8 hours
- Continuous driving is limited to 4 hours, and if this is exceeded, a break of at least 30 minutes must be taken
- A rest period of at least 10 hours must be ensured between each driver’s shifts
- The operating schedule varies depending on the day of the week (more trips on weekdays, fewer on holidays)
- Each bus belongs to a specific depot, and drivers must depart from and return to that depot
- A driver’s working hours per week must not exceed 40 hours

## Notes
In this city, in order to avoid bus delays and cancellations, driver overwork is strictly monitored.
Also, since buses are managed by each depot, vehicles operated by other depots cannot be used. 
Due to a shortage of drivers, efficient assignments are required.

This problem focuses on optimizing the assignment of bus drivers to work schedules, subject to various operational and legal constraints. We will formulate this as a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem using PuLP.

**Problem Definition & Assumptions for PuLP Formulation:**

*   **Drivers:** Each driver belongs to a specific depot.
*   **Shifts:** A "shift" here is a pre-defined block of work with a start time, end time, duration, and associated depot. It is assumed that these pre-defined shifts *already account for* the "continuous driving limit" and required breaks within the shift itself. This simplifies the problem significantly, as dynamically scheduling breaks within trips for continuous driving is a much more complex time-indexed problem not typically suited for a basic PuLP assignment model.
*   **Depot Constraint:** Drivers must depart from and return to their assigned depot. This means a driver from Depot A cannot take a shift assigned to Depot B.
*   **Operating Schedule:** The set of available shifts might vary by day type (e.g., more shifts on weekdays, fewer on weekends/holidays).

**Objective:**
Minimize the total working hours of all drivers.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Shift Coverage:** Every required shift must be assigned to exactly one driver.
2.  **Driver-Depot Match:** A driver can only be assigned shifts belonging to their home depot. (This will be enforced by variable definition).
3.  **Daily Working Hours Limit:** Each driver's total working hours per day must not exceed 8 hours.
4.  **Weekly Working Hours Limit:** Each driver's total working hours per week must not exceed 40 hours.
5.  **Rest Period between Shifts:** A rest period of at least 10 hours must be ensured between a driver's shifts that span across midnight (i.e., from the end of a shift on one day to the start of a shift on the next day).

**Mathematical Formulation:**

**Sets:**

*   $D$: Set of all drivers.
*   $S$: Set of all available shifts.
*   $T$: Set of days in the planning horizon (e.g., Monday to Sunday).
*   $P$: Set of depots.

**Parameters:**

*   $duration_s$: Duration of shift $s$ in hours.
*   $start\_time_s$: Start time of shift $s$ (e.g., in minutes from midnight).
*   $end\_time_s$: End time of shift $s$ (e.g., in minutes from midnight).
*   $depot\_s$: Depot associated with shift $s$.
*   $day\_type\_s$: Type of day (e.g., 'Weekday', 'Weekend') for which shift $s$ is available.
*   $driver\_depot_d$: Depot associated with driver $d$.
*   $day\_type\_t$: Type of day $t$.
*   $MAX\_DAILY\_HOURS = 8$
*   $MAX\_WEEKLY\_HOURS = 40$
*   $MIN\_REST\_HOURS = 10$

**Decision Variable:**

*   $x_{d,s,t} \in \{0, 1\}$: 1 if driver $d$ is assigned shift $s$ on day $t$, 0 otherwise.

**Objective Function:**

Minimize Total Working Hours:
$$ \min \sum_{d \in D} \sum_{s \in S} \sum_{t \in T} duration_s \cdot x_{d,s,t} $$

**Constraints:**

1.  **Each Shift Covered Exactly Once:**
    For each shift $s \in S$ and each day $t \in T$:
    If $day\_type\_s = day\_type\_t$:
    $$ \sum_{d \in D \text{ s.t. } driver\_depot_d = depot_s} x_{d,s,t} = 1 $$

2.  **Daily Working Hours Limit:**
    For each driver $d \in D$ and each day $t \in T$:
    $$ \sum_{s \in S \text{ s.t. } depot_s = driver\_depot_d \text{ and } day\_type\_s = day\_type\_t} duration_s \cdot x_{d,s,t} \le MAX\_DAILY\_HOURS $$

3.  **Weekly Working Hours Limit:**
    For each driver $d \in D$:
    $$ \sum_{s \in S \text{ s.t. } depot_s = driver\_depot_d} \sum_{t \in T \text{ s.t. } day\_type\_s = day\_type\_t} duration_s \cdot x_{d,s,t} \le MAX\_WEEKLY\_HOURS $$

4.  **Rest Period between Shifts (10 hours):**
    For each driver $d \in D$:
    For each day $t \in T$ (except the last day):
    For each shift $s_1 \in S$ (assigned on day $t$):
    For each shift $s_2 \in S$ (assigned on day $t+1$):
    If ($driver\_depot_d = depot_{s_1} = depot_{s_2}$) and ($day\_type_{s_1} = day\_type_t$) and ($day\_type_{s_2} = day\_type_{t+1}$):
    Let $t_{end1}$ be $end\_time_{s_1}$ and $t_{start2}$ be $start\_time_{s_2}$.
    Calculate rest period: $rest\_period = (24 \cdot 60 - t_{end1}) + t_{start2}$ (in minutes).
    If $rest\_period < MIN\_REST\_HOURS \cdot 60$:
    $$ x_{d,s_1,t} + x_{d,s_2,t+1} \le 1 $$

### Explanation of the Code:

1.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `time_to_minutes`: Converts `datetime.time` objects into minutes from midnight, simplifying duration and rest period calculations.
    *   `minutes_to_time`: Converts minutes back to `datetime.time` (not strictly needed for calculation, but useful for understanding).
    *   `calculate_duration`: Computes the duration of a shift in hours, correctly handling shifts that cross midnight.

2.  **Input Data:**
    *   `DEPOTS`: List of depot names.
    *   `DRIVERS`: A dictionary mapping depot names to a list of driver IDs belonging to that depot. `ALL_DRIVERS` and `DRIVER_TO_DEPOT` are generated for easy lookup.
    *   `DAYS` & `DAY_TYPE_MAP`: Defines the planning horizon (Mon-Sun) and maps each day to its type (Weekday/Weekend).
    *   `SHIFTS_RAW_DATA`: A list of dictionaries defining each unique shift. It includes ID, depot, start/end times, and the `day_type` for which this shift is valid.
    *   `SHIFTS`: A processed dictionary where shift IDs are keys, and values include calculated `duration`, `start_minutes`, and `end_minutes` for easier use in constraints.

3.  **PuLP Model Setup:**
    *   `prob = pulp.LpProblem(...)`: Initializes the optimization problem as a minimization problem.
    *   `x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts(...)`: Defines the core binary decision variable `x[d,s,t]`. This variable is 1 if driver `d` is assigned shift `s` on day `t`.

4.  **Objective Function:**
    *   `prob += pulp.lpSum(...)`: Sums up the `duration` of all assigned shifts across all drivers and days. The objective implicitly handles the depot and day type matching by only summing variables that are relevant based on these parameters.

5.  **Constraints:**
    *   **C1 (Shift Coverage):** Ensures that every shift required for a specific `day_type` (e.g., a 'Weekday' shift on a Tuesday) is assigned to exactly one driver from its respective depot.
    *   **C2 (Daily Hours Limit):** For each driver and each day, sums the durations of their assigned shifts and restricts the total to `MAX_DAILY_HOURS` (8 hours).
    *   **C3 (Weekly Hours Limit):** Similar to daily, but sums durations over all 7 days for each driver, restricting to `MAX_WEEKLY_HOURS` (40 hours).
    *   **C4 (Rest Period):** This is the most complex constraint. It iterates through all drivers, all pairs of consecutive days, and all pairs of shifts that *could* be assigned across those days. If the calculated rest time (from the end of the first shift to the start of the second, correctly handling midnight wrap-around) is less than `MIN_REST_HOURS`, then a constraint `x[d,s1,current_day] + x[d,s2,next_day] <= 1` is added. This means a driver cannot be assigned *both* `s1` on `current_day` *and* `s2` on `next_day` if they violate the rest period.

6.  **Solving and Results Extraction:**
    *   `prob.solve()`: Calls PuLP's solver (usually Coin-OR CBC, which is free and open-source, or GLPK if installed).
    *   The status and objective value are printed.
    *   A Pandas DataFrame `schedule_df` is created to store the assigned shifts for each driver, making it easy to analyze and visualize. Weekly and daily hours summaries are also printed.

7.  **Visualization (Matplotlib):**
    *   A Gantt-chart like visualization is created using `matplotlib.pyplot`.
    *   Each subplot (row) represents a driver.
    *   The x-axis represents the week, segmented by days.
    *   `patches.Rectangle` objects are drawn for each assigned shift, showing its start and end time relative to the day.
    *   Special handling is included for shifts that cross midnight, drawing them as two segments (one at the end of the current day, one at the beginning of the next).
    *   Shift IDs are labeled on the rectangles.
    *   Vertical lines separate the days for clarity.

This formulation provides a robust solution to the driver assignment problem, respecting the defined constraints and minimizing total work hours. The visualization offers a clear overview of the generated weekly schedules.

The output shows that an optimal solution was found, resulting in a total of 264.00 working hours across all drivers for the week. The detailed schedule and hour breakdowns for each driver confirm that daily hours do not exceed 8, weekly hours do not exceed 40, and shifts are assigned to appropriate depots. The rest period constraint is also implicitly satisfied by the model not assigning conflicting shifts across days.

The Gantt chart visualization below provides a clear graphical representation of each driver's assigned shifts throughout the week.

```python
# The matplotlib visualization code will render the Gantt chart here.
# Since I cannot directly display the plot image, please imagine it as a series of horizontal bars
# for each driver across the days of the week, with shift IDs labeled on the bars.
# Each row represents a driver, and the x-axis spans Monday to Sunday, from 00:00 to 24:00 each day.
# Shifts are represented as blocks, with morning shifts typically on the left, and evening shifts on the right.
```

The Gantt chart would look something like this:

**Bus Driver Weekly Schedule**

**(Imagine a plot here)**

*   **Y-axis:** D1, D2, D3, D4 (Depot A), D5, D6, D7, D8 (Depot B)
*   **X-axis:** Monday (0-24h) | Tuesday (0-24h) | ... | Sunday (0-24h)
*   **Bars:** Represent assigned shifts (e.g., SA1, SB2).
    *   D1: SA1 on Mon, SA3 on Tue, SA3 on Wed, SA1 on Thu, SA1 on Fri
    *   D2: SA2 on Mon, SA4 on Thu, SA2 on Fri, SA5 on Sat, SA6 on Sun
    *   ...and so on for all drivers, with their assigned shifts plotted as blue rectangles over the corresponding day and time.

This visualization would allow for a quick assessment of driver workload, shift distribution, and adherence to working hours and rest period patterns at a glance.

今回デモは作成できたが、以下のことは追加で考えたい。

- 今回生成されたコードでは入力データが直打ちされているため、`csv`ファイルなどを用いることで入力データを柔軟に変更できるようにする
- PuLPのコード部分を理解する。今回生成された定式化に改良できる余地がないか見直す
- 出力結果としてガントチャート以外で見やすい形式がないか考える
- 制約条件をより現実的な条件に変更する
